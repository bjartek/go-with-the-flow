# Go with the Flow

Set of go scripts to make it easer to run a Story consisting of creating accounts, deploying contracts, executing transactions and running scripts on the Flow Blockchain.

Feel free to ask questions to @bjartek in the Flow Discord.

v2 of GoWithTheFlow removed a lot of the code in favor of `flowkit` in the flow-cli. Some of the code from here was
contributed by me into flow-cli like the goroutine based event fetcher.

Breaking changes between v1 and v2:
 - v1 had a config section for discord webhooks. That has been removed since the flow-cli will remove extra config things in flow.json. Store the webhook url in an env variable and use it as argument when creating the DiscordWebhook struct.

Special thanks to @sideninja for helping me get my changes into flow-cli.

## Main features
 - Create a single go file that will start emulator, deploy contracts, create accounts and run scripts and transactions. see `examples/demo/main.go` 
 - Fetch events, store progress in a file and send results to Discord. see `examples/event/main.go`
 - Support inline scripts if you do not want to sture everything in a file when testing 
 - Supports writing tests against transactions and scripts with some limitations on how to implement them. 
 - Asserts to make it easier to use the library in writing tests see `examples/transaction_test.go` for examples

## Gotchas
 - When specifying extra accounts that are created on emulator they are created in alphabetical order, the addresses the emulator assign is always fixed. 
 - tldr; Name your stakeholder acounts in alphabetical order

## Examples

In order to run the demo example you only have to run `make` in the example folder of this project. 
The emulator will be run in memory.
